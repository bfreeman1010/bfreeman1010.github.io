title: Example Research Page (YAML)
intro: >
  This page is driven by YAML data in `edit/data/example_page.yml` and rendered by `_pages/example-yaml.md`.
sections:
  - title: Section Title + Body
    title_link: /example-yaml/
    body: >
      Use `title` for the section heading and `body` for text. The body supports **Markdown**,
      so you can include emphasis, lists, and inline code.
    note: >
      To make the title a link, set `title_link` in YAML. The hover color is controlled by
      the theme CSS (matching the Service page style), which uses the theme link color on hover.
  - title: Hyperlinks
    body: >
      Add links as an array and render them as a list.
    links:
      - label: Integrated Computing Lab
        url: https://bfreeman1010.github.io/
      - label: Google Scholar
        url: https://scholar.google.com/
  - title: Images (Zoom Enabled)
    body: >
      These images use `zoom: true` so they open with the zoom effect.
    images:
      - path: /assets/img/1.jpg
        caption: "Zoomable image example (1.jpg)"
        zoom: true
        text_after: "This is an example sentence between images to show spacing and flow."
      - path: /assets/img/2.jpg
        caption: "Zoomable image example (2.jpg)"
        zoom: true
  - title: Images (No Zoom)
    body: >
      These images omit zoom, so they stay static.
    images:
      - path: /assets/img/3.jpg
        caption: "Static image example (3.jpg)"
        zoom: false
        text_after: "Another paragraph between photos to demonstrate layout behavior."
      - path: /assets/img/4.jpg
        caption: "Static image example (4.jpg)"
        zoom: false
  - title: Image Locations + Paths
    body: >
      Store image files in `assets/img/`. Reference them in YAML as `/assets/img/your-file.jpg`.
  - title: Image Sizes (Fixed, Max-Width, Percentage)
    body: >
      You can control image size with `width`, `height`, or `max_width`. These examples show
      fixed pixel sizes and a max width constraint.
    images:
      - path: /assets/img/5.jpg
        caption: "Fixed width/height (300x200)"
        zoom: false
        width: "300px"
        height: "200px"
      - path: /assets/img/6.jpg
        caption: "Max width constraint (max 400px)"
        zoom: false
        max_width: "400px"
  - title: Text Wrap (Left / Right / Center)
    body: >
      These examples show how to wrap text around images by floating them left or right.
      Centered images do not wrap; they sit above the text.
    wrap_images:
      - path: /assets/img/7.jpg
        caption: "Float left with text wrap"
        zoom: false
        wrap: left
        width: "220px"
        text: >
          This text wraps around the image floated to the left. Use `wrap: left` and a fixed
          `width` to control the layout.
      - path: /assets/img/8.jpg
        caption: "Float right with text wrap"
        zoom: false
        wrap: right
        width: "220px"
        text: >
          This text wraps around the image floated to the right. Use `wrap: right` and a fixed
          `width` to control the layout.
      - path: /assets/img/9.jpg
        caption: "Centered image (no wrap)"
        zoom: false
        wrap: center
        width: "260px"
        text: >
          Centered images do not wrap text. Use `wrap: center` to keep the image centered with
          the text below it.
  - title: Left-Aligned Section Title
    title_class: icl-section-title
    body: >
      This section uses the `icl-section-title` class (same as the Mission Statement page).
      Set `title_class: icl-section-title` in YAML to get a left-aligned title with an underline.
  - title: Left-Aligned Title (No Underline)
    title_class: section-title-no-line
    body: >
      Use `title_class: section-title-no-line` to keep the title left-aligned without the
      underline, while still using theme text colors.
