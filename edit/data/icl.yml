  - title: Who We Are
    body: >
      We are a diverse, international, and collaborative team of researchers in the
      [Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering and Engineering Management (ISEEM)](https://www.uah.edu/eng/departments/iseem)
      at the University of Alabama in Huntsville. We believe that science is a team sport, and we
      support one another in thriving both within and beyond academia through formal and informal
      mentorship. Our shared goal is to create and share globally relevant knowledge in design and
      manufacturing - fields that deeply fascinate us - while inspiring similar enthusiasm in
      students, collaborators, and the public. We strive to build AI-driven systems to address
      complex challenges in design and systems science. Positivity, balance, respect, passion,
      curiosity, integrity, and inclusiveness define our lab culture. Above all, we pursue design,
      systems, and manufacturing research with a commitment to equity, ethical practice, and
      genuine partnership with our communities.
  - title: What We Do
    body: >
      We are driven by the belief that intelligent, trustworthy, and transparent computational tools
      can empower engineers to design safer, more sustainable, and more resilient systems. In the
      Integrated Computing Lab (ICL), we study how machine learning models can understand and capture
      complex behaviors in physical and engineering systems. To do this, we design hybrid model
      architectures that couple data-driven networks with simulation-based physics, enabling the
      development of trustworthy digital artifacts for aerospace, manufacturing, and energy systems.
  - title: Questions We Ask
    body: >
      How can we integrate physics-based and data-driven models to improve manufacturing processes,
      decision-making, and trade-off analysis? What are the most effective model architectures and
      mathematical representations for capturing complex systems and addressing ill-defined design
      challenges?
