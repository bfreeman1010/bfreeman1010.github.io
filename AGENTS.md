# Guidance for Future Agents

This repo uses a custom layout so content edits are separated from templates/styles.

## Where to edit content
- Pages live in `_pages/`.
- Page data lives in `edit/data/`.
  - `edit/data/people.yml` for the People page.
  - `edit/data/service.yml` for Service activities/images.
  - `edit/data/projects_page.yml` for Projects sections.
  - `edit/data/icl.yml` for Integrated Computing Lab sections.
  - `edit/data/repositories.yml` for GitHub user/repo lists.

## Where to edit templates and styles
- Layouts: `theme/layouts/`
- Includes: `theme/includes/`
- Sass: `_sass/` (compiled by `assets/css/main.scss`)

## Adding a new page
1) Create a file in `_pages/` with front matter:
```
---
layout: page
title: Page Title
permalink: /page-title/
description: Short summary.
nav: true
nav_order: 11
---
```
2) Add content directly in the file, or read from YAML in `edit/data/`.

## Adding images
- Store images in `assets/img/`.
- Reference them as `/assets/img/your-image.png` in pages or YAML.
- For Service images, add entries in `edit/data/service.yml`.

## Custom CSS
- Add or change styles in `_sass/_base.scss` or `_sass/_layout.scss`.
- Rebuild to update `assets/css/main.css`.

## Timeline feature
- Timeline styles are in `theme/includes/timeline.liquid` and related Sass.
- If adding a timeline section, include the partial where needed and add content via YAML or page HTML.

## Search index exclusions
- Search data is generated by `_scripts/search.liquid.js`.
- To exclude content types, update the collection filtering logic there.

## Config pointers
- `_config.yml` sets custom paths:
  - `data_dir: edit/data`
  - `includes_dir: theme/includes`
  - `layouts_dir: theme/layouts`
  - `sass_dir: _sass`
