**[Dr. Cheng Chen](https://www.uah.edu/eng/faculty-staff/cheng-chen)** is an assistant professor in the [Department of Industrial & Systems Engineering & Engineering Management (ISEEM)](https://www.uah.edu/eng/departments/iseem). Our group is fascinated by implementing Large Language Models (LLMs) and digital threads to tackle the challenges of complex systems in design and manufacturing. We investigate how engineering changes spread across requirement management domains, emphasizing the importance of managing these changes to prevent failures in complex design systems. Our research aims to understand how different architectures of digital threads are built and controlled to trace design changes across various domains of the product lifecycle. Additionally, our manufacturing research interests span the area of predictive maintenance, synthetic data generation, and generative design. His applied research involves collaborating with experts from academia and industry on projects that use Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) solutions when designing sustainable manufacturing processes to improve assembly efficiency.
